# Extract Kit üöÄ

Welcome to **Extract Kit** - a powerful, modern solution for document data extraction and conversion, powered by AI vision models! Transform your PDFs and Office documents into structured, validated data with ease.

> üåü **Inspired by [Sparrow](https://github.com/katanaml/sparrow)** - This project builds upon the innovative concepts from Katana ML's Sparrow framework, reimagined with modern TypeScript, Bun runtime, and enhanced AI vision capabilities.
